We share a passion for EVs and their ability to make life easier and more sustainable.  EVs offer unmatched energy efficiency, operating cost and cleanness. We believe in their potential to make automobiles the most entertaining, comfortable, purposeful and affordable we ever had.We provide authoritative analysis, data, policy recommendations and solutions to ensure energy security and help the world transition to clean energy. Weâ€™ve carried out research around the world on energy statistics, modelling, technology, energy efficiency and renewable policies. For developing this website me and my team member have used the concept of HTML,CSS,Javascript, and somewhat Python.
